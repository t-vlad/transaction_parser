Transaction Parser
=================

Small application that can process transaction data as input (CSV) and ouputs CSV,
with the resulting account situation.

To build:
- cargo build

To run:
- cargo run -- input.csv > output.csv


TODO:
 - better comments in the code
 - maybe ability to parse more than one input file (a folder, a path)
 - look into how this can be made more efficient, memory wise
